# treehouse_string_length
Part of Treehouse JS course practice. Creates prompts that store user name and surname and then outputs these with the character count.

In detail, this is what needs to be done:

1. Attach the file -- practice.js -- to the index.html file using a <script> tag.

2. In this JavaScript file, add a prompt dialog to capture input from the user and store it in a variable.

3. Add a second a prompt dialog to capture input from the user and store it in a second variable.

4. Create a third variable and which combines an uppercase version values in the two other variables separated by a space. For example, if the first two variables contain "sally" and "forth", this third variable should contain the string value "SALLY FORTH".

5. Create a fourth variable to store a number. The number should be the total number of characters in the third variable. 

6. Add an alert dialog box that says "The string '[insert value of third variable here]' is X number of characters long." For example, if the third variable contained the string "SALLY FORTH" then the alert dialog should says "The string 'SALLY FORTH' is 11 characters long."
